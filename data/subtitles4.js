The SBI\n\n00:07.900 --> 00:10.160\nmethod, short for situation Behavior impact,\n\n00:10.800 --> 00:14.200\nkeeps feedback clear and focused. You begin by\n\n00:14.700 --> 00:18.160\ndescribing the situation, then the specific behavior you observed,\n\n00:18.400 --> 00:21.520\nand finally explain the impact that behavior had.\n\n00:22.080 --> 00:26.160\nThis method is direct, objective, and reduces misunderstandings.\n\n00:27.040 --> 00:30.440\nThe sandwich method, on the other hand, is designed to soften\n\n00:30.940 --> 00:34.320\nthe delivery of constructive feedback. You start with a positive comment,\n\n00:34.560 --> 00:38.040\nthen place the critical feedback in the middle and close with another\n\n00:38.540 --> 00:41.880\npositive. This approach helps maintain the employee\'s morale\n\n00:42.380 --> 00:45.760\nand motivation, though it can sometimes make the feedback less direct.\n\n00:46.480 --> 00:50.120\nBoth methods can be effective. It\'s up to you as a leader to\n\n00:50.620 --> 00:53.520\nchoose the one that fits your context and the needs of your employee.\n\n"
